#### Background
Föreningshuset helps mainly mainly non-profit organizations with membership administration, events, payments and accounting. They had several apps - one for organisation members, one for organisation administrators and then two different apps for administrator and accounting employees at Föreningshuset.

All these applications had different layouts, navigation patterns and visual design. First of all this was confusing for some users that were exposed to several of the apps. Secondly it also made harder for the product team to update the design of the apps - any design changes had to be manually in all four apps.

#### Solution
The solution was a design system consisting of components, patterns and guidelines for creating digital products. The design system is also flexible so that it can be white-labeled and branded according to our customers needs.

I also executed the design system into a SCSS framework with corresponding documentation for use by developers.
