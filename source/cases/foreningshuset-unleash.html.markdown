One of the projects I completed whilst working for Föreningshuset was Unleash. A design system consisting of components, patterns and guidelines for creating digital products. The design system needs to flexible as it is white-labeled and branded according to our customers needs.

I also executed the design system into a SCSS framework with corresponding documentation for use by developers.
