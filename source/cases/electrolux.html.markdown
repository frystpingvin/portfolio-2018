#### Background
The Swedish home appliance manufacturer Electrolux came to Hyper Island to get new ideas on how their users lives can be improved by connected accessories, services and partnerships in 2026. We we're asked to focus on experiences around food, but not the cooking process itself.

#### 1. Research
We started out the project by doing both quantitative and qualitative research. We created several journay maps of users current experience around food, both in the home but also their experiences of planning and shopping groceries.

From our research we deconstructed the experience around food into these areas:

* Planning
* Shopping
* Storing and refrigerating
* Cooking
* Eating
* Cleaning
* Food waste

From the users we talked to, we concluded that the main painpoints in this experience was **planning**, **shopping** and **food waste**. People usually enjoyed the act of shopping in physical stores, touching and looking at groceries, when they had the time - for example when preparing for a dinner with friends on a weekend.

On weekdays however, people saw planning and shopping as chore. They aren't very inclined to try new recipes during busy weekdays and mainly make food with easy and quick recipes that they already know in their memory. Not having full knowledge of what they have at home and when items expire also made people buy groceries - only to find out that they already have it at home.

To get a better understanding of how the world can look in 2026, we participated in a workshop called [Actionable Futures Toolkit](https://futures.nordkapp.fi/) with it's creater Sami Niemel√§ to try to foresight the future.

#### 2. Ideation
To finish up our research and kick off ideation we invited the Electrolux design team to an ideation workshop that I facilitated. We shared some research and together ideated on solutions to solve the identified painpoints.

Some of the ideas include using image recognition to read and calculate expiry dates of the groceries you have at home and machine learning identifying your shopping habits and sharing this data with potential business partners.

#### 3. Prototyping
From the choosen ideas we created two prototypes to get feedback from potential users.

The first was an experimental and exploratory prototype where we used fake appliances and acted out the machine learning system that identifies your shopping and eating habits.

In the original prototype the machine learning system was used to give recipe recommendations through a voice interface, but our test users gave us feedback that they aren't interested in trying out new recipes during busy weekdays. When trying to find new recipes they also enjoyed the the process of exploring and looking at pictures of different dishes - so replacing this process with a voice interface wasn't appreciated.

Iterating from this feedback, we realized that we could **remove the painpoint of planning and shopping groceries** during weekdays all together. During our research users told us that they mostly cook a couple of recipes recurringly on weekdays, so with machine learning we can learn what groceries are used for these recipes. This info can then be shared with third parties, so for example and AI assistant can purchase the groceries for home delivery whenever they start to run out - **making sure that the user always has some base groceries to cook their favourite quick and healthy meals at home**.

The second prototype was a way to indentify food in your fridge that will expire soon with image recognition. This info was then shared by lighting up the product to inform the user that this should be cooked or eaten soon. We tried this prototype on user and realized that the static light wasn't noticable enough, it should be pulsating to communicate more clearly.

#### 4. Delivery
The final delivery for Electrolux was some future opportunities as well as concept videos for the machine learning system where the data can be shared with for example grocery stores and for minimizing food waste by letting the the fridge identify and communicate groceries that soon will expire. Here you can see the concept video for the machine learning system.
